# Loan Approval Automation Project

This project aims to automate the loan approval processes of financial institutions, thereby reducing the turnaround time for loan requests and removing biases. The objective is to create a machine learning model that accurately predicts loan approvals, optimizing the decision-making process.

## Project Workflow

1. **Loading and Exploring Data:**
   - Load the dataset from the local machine.
   - Check for null values in the dataset.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Drop unnecessary columns like 'Loan_ID' and 'Dependents.'
   - Handle missing values, starting with categorical values.
   - Replace null values in categorical columns with the mode.
   - Address missing data in numerical columns.

3. **Visualization:**
   - Explore feature relationships through visualizations, including pair plots and correlation matrices.

4. **Encoding Categorical Data:**
   - Use both ordinal and one-hot encoding to handle categorical features.
   - Apply Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to address class imbalance.

5. **Model Development:**
   - Split the data into test and train sets.
   - Implement various machine learning models, including GaussianNB, SVC with Grid Search CV, XGBoost Classifier, Decision Tree with randomized search, and Random Forest with randomized search.

6. **Selecting and Saving the Model:**
   - Evaluate model performance based on precision, recall, and accuracy.
   - Select the XGBoost Classifier as the recommended model for its well-balanced results.
   - Save the chosen model for future use.

7. **Deployment:**
   - Discuss the deployment of the chosen model for practical use in loan approval systems.

## Model Comparison and Analysis

- **XGBoost Classifier:**
  - Precision: 0.8172
  - Recall: 0.9048
  - Accuracy: 0.8521
  - Offers a well-balanced performance, suitable for accurate loan approval decisions.

- **Random Forest with Randomized Search:**
  - Precision: 0.7917
  - Recall: 0.9048
  - Accuracy: 0.8343
  - Provides a good balance between precision, recall, and accuracy.

- **Decision Tree with Randomized Search:**
  - Precision: 0.7647
  - Recall: 0.7738
  - Accuracy: 0.7692
  - Shows decent performance but slightly lower than Random Forest.

- **SVC with GridSearchCV:**
  - Precision: 0.5031
  - Recall: 0.9762
  - Accuracy: 0.5089
  - High recall but low precision, may not be suitable for loan approval where precision is crucial.

- **GaussianNB:**
  - Precision: 0.6907
  - Recall: 0.7976
  - Accuracy: 0.7219
  - Provides moderate performance, but precision and recall are not as high as other models.

- **Stacking Model:**
  - Precision: 0.733
  - Recall: 0.75
  - Commendable performance, but XGBoost outperforms in overall accuracy and balanced trade-off.

## Model Recommendation

Considering the importance of both minimizing false positives and false negatives in loan approval decisions, the XGBoost Classifier emerges as the recommended algorithm. With its high precision and recall, XGBoost provides a well-balanced and effective solution for the specific challenges posed by loan prediction scenarios.

## Hyperparameter Tuning and Comparison

The hyperparameter-tuned Random Forest narrows the performance gap but does not surpass the XGBoost Classifier, which maintains a slightly better accuracy and precision. The final decision between the two models should consider factors such as computational efficiency, interpretability, and specific application goals.

## Conclusion

In the context of predicting loan approvals, precision and recall are pivotal. After thorough evaluation, the XGBoost Classifier demonstrates superior performance, making it the recommended algorithm for ensuring accurate and well-balanced loan approval decisions.
